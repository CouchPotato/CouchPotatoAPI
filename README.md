CouchPotato API

This is what has been running on api.couchpota.to sinds 2013. It was never meant to be released to public, but I've decided to shut down the server it has been running on for these years.

I don't really have the steps on how to get it running. I think just copy the example.config.js to config.js, fill in the API keys and go from there. If anyone actually intends to run this locally, let me know, we can have a look together ;)
